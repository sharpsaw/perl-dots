perl-dots
=========

Perl-related dotfiles and scripts for `...`

Perl CLI Stuff
--------------

grepsubs - Colorize `package` and `sub` lines of a file. (also \gs in vim)

Vim Stuff
---------

Look in `.vim/ftplugin/*.vim` (note, the auto-running of ftplugin stuff
depends on `filetype plugin indent on` (actually the `indent` part of that
isn't related, but it's good.)).

Context
-------

Why "-dots"?  See: http://github.com/ouicode/rkingy-dots
